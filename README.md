**Motivation**

Listing RUNE benefits the Aave community in the following ways:

1. First-Mover: RUNE has only recently been made available as an ERC-20 asset, and Aave would be the first venue to make RUNE borrowing available.
2. Community and New Users: The THORChain community is extremely strong, vocal and eager to support related projects. This listing would bring a strong influx of new users.
3. Economic Bandwidth: the total economic value available in THORChain is approaching $1bn, up from ~$85m just 90 days ago.

**Specifications**

_What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?_
Oaksprout is a long-term community member of THORChain and holder of RUNE. He has also spent a lot of time in the Aave community and holds AAVE.

_Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token_
THORChain is a decentralised network focused on bringing liquidity to cross-chain assets. It does this using a simple Uniswap-like automated market maker (AMM) design. Some have called it “Uniswap for the multichain world”.

THORChain has been live with mainnet assets since September 2020 and its flagship multichain network is scheduled to go to testnet imminently.

The project is built on tried-and-tested technical and economic primitives, including Tendermint BFT, Cosmos SDK, Gennaro and Goldfeder’s Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) and a variant on Uniswap’s constant function market making formula.

_Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?_

_Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions_

_How is the asset currently used?_

_Token permissions and upgradability_
