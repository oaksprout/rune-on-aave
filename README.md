## Motivation

Listing RUNE benefits the Aave community in the following ways:

1. First-Mover: RUNE has only recently been made available as an ERC-20 asset, and Aave would be the first venue to make RUNE borrowing available.
2. Community and New Users: The THORChain community is extremely strong, vocal and eager to support related projects. This listing would bring a strong influx of new users.
3. Economic Bandwidth: the total economic value available in THORChain is approaching $1bn, up from ~$85m just 90 days ago.

## Specifications

### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Oaksprout is a long-term community member of THORChain and holder of RUNE. He has also spent a lot of time in the Aave community and holds AAVE.

### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

THORChain is a decentralised network focused on bringing liquidity to cross-chain assets. It does this using a simple Uniswap-like automated market maker (AMM) design. Some have called it “Uniswap for the multichain world”.

THORChain has been live with mainnet assets since September 2020 and its flagship multichain network is scheduled to go to testnet imminently.

The project is built on tried-and-tested technical and economic primitives, including Tendermint BFT, Cosmos SDK, Gennaro and Goldfeder’s Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) and a variant on Uniswap’s constant function market making formula.

### Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

### Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions

### How is the asset currently used?

### Emission schedule

Current circulating supply of RUNE is 238,275,761. Total circulating supply will
be 500 million.

Current circulating supply of RUNE in ERC-20 form is 10,075,916. Current maximum
supply on Ethereum is 20 million. This number was recently doubled from
10 million.

Figures sourced from CoinGecko data on [BEP2
RUNE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/thorchain) and [ERC-20
RUNE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/thorchain-erc20). [See further details
on THORChain's](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-rune-erc-20-thorchain/2239/4?u=oaksprout) ERC-20 version of RUNE.

THORChain rewards early behaviour by giving out RUNE to active participants. It
gives out 1/6 of its reserve each year. THORChain aims to reach 2% annual
inflation after 10 years.
